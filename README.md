# social-media-site
This is the code for my social media site project, Colloquy. The site was meant to be more of a first exploration of how
PHP, MySQL, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS work together. Originally, it was intended to be a twitter clone, but spun off a bit for the sake of
creativity. I wanted to focus more on function than aesthetic for this project, and thus it is very sparsely styled, with bootstrap 
accounting for most of the styling. I got pretty far with the level of skill that I had at the time of creating this site. However, while 
I learned quite a lot about what I should do from its construction, it mostly served to show me just how much I still had to learn. 

To be perfectly honest, there is a plethora of things within and without this code that I would never do again, were I to redo this project.
It features jQuery jungles, class names and file structures that are far too monolithic and whimsical for the scale on which they are
implemented, terrible chat algorithms, jQuery media queries rather than CSS media queries, etc. There are redeeming qualities in this 
project as well, and I think its important to show that I've learned from the past and that I was even doing certain things quite well in
the past to begin with. I've undoubtedly come very far since this project, and you'll really see that in a number of my other repositories.

Despite its numerous faults, this project is certainly a fully functioning social media site. It allows the user to create accounts, 
upload media, follow other users/see who's following them, make/view posts, update profile information, chat directly with other users, and
much more, in a barebones environment that isn't as hard on the eyes as it could be.
